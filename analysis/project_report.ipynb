    "In 2020, the number of reported hate crimes in the United States rose 6 percent from 2019, according to the FBI [1]. About 62 percent of reported hate crimes were racially motivated [2]. To get further insight into hate crimes, we can look at a well-studied country like Germany where researchers have examined the role of social media on the frequency of hate crimes. According to a research paper by Karsten MÃ¼ller and Carlo Schwarz, increased anti-refugee rhetoric and sentiments on social media has been correlated with an increased frequency in anti-refugee hate crimes in Germany [3]. Therefore, we are interested in the role of social media on hate crimes in the United States, while also investigating other aspects of hate crimes such as motivation and location. Some questions we are interested in including:\n",
    "* Who are those most vulnerable to crimes?\n",
    "* What biases are the strongest motivators in hate crimes?\n",
    "* Where are the most crimes taking place (e.g. populated cities, rural towns, etc.)?\n",
    "* Is there a correlation with search trends/social media usage and hate crimes?\n",
    "* Narrowing into specific cities (e.g. Sacramento) and specific hate crimes (e.g. against a racial group), is there an increase in sentiment against a particular group when there is increased hate crime against that particular group in that city?"
