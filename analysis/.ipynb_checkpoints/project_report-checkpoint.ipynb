    "In 2020, the number of reported hate crimes in the United States rose 6 percent from 2019, according to the FBI [1]. About 62 percent of reported hate crimes were racially motivated [2]. To get further insight into hate crimes, we can look at a well-studied country like Germany where researchers have examined the role of social media on the frequency of hate crimes. According to a research paper by Karsten Müller and Carlo Schwarz, increased anti-refugee rhetoric and sentiments on social media has been correlated with an increased frequency in anti-refugee hate crimes in Germany [3]. Therefore, we are interested in the role of social media on hate crimes in the United States, while also investigating other aspects of hate crimes such as motivation and location. Some questions we are interested in including:\n",
    "* Who are those most vulnerable to crimes?\n",
    "* What biases are the strongest motivators in hate crimes?\n",
    "* Where are the most crimes taking place (e.g. populated cities, rural towns, etc.)?\n",
    "* Is there a correlation with search trends/social media usage and hate crimes?\n",
    "* Narrowing into specific cities (e.g. Sacramento) and specific hate crimes (e.g. against a racial group), is there an increase in sentiment against a particular group when there is increased hate crime against that particular group in that city?"

    "To obtain data about hate crimes in the United States and California, we are using the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s 1991-2020 Hate Crime Dataset (hc), which is downloadable from their Crime Data Explore webpage (<a href = https://crime-data-explorer.app.cloud.gov/pages/downloads>FBI Crime Data Explorer</a>). The dataset contains pertinent information, such as the year, the motivation (\"bias_desc\"), and location (\"state_abbr\", \"pub_agency_name\"), on reported hate crimes across the U.S from 1991-2020. The dataset is overall complete, but has a few formatting issues. The column names were in inconsistent letter casing, so we made them all lower cases, and renamed column names to make them more simplistic, such as renaming “data_year” to “year”. Missing values and unnecessary columns were removed from the dataset. One interesting thing is that “Nebraska” was abbreviated “NB” when the official abbreviation for it is “NE.” This was an issue when trying to generate maps that relied on the official abbreviation, so this issue was fixed by replacing “NB” for “NE” in the “state_abbr” column. Since there were so many different specific biases, each bias was assigned a bias category for a more standardized analysis. Some reported hate crime incidents had more than one bias, so these were removed since they were only a few and would make subsequent visualizations more messy."

The top 5 race/ethnicities that experienced an uptick in hate crimes are those of Multiple Races, White, Asian, Black or African American, and Eastern Orthodox. According to the BBC, the rise in hate crimes against Asians is due to the misinformation and negative attention brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, since COVID-19 originated from China (<a href = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56218684>Cabral 2021</a>). Since the Black Lives Matter Movement that started in 2013, more attention--good and bad--have been placed on Black people. According to Dr. Emmitt Y. Riley, III, this has led to racial tension and resentment from White people, which may contribute to the rise in hate crime against Black people (<a href = https://www.ucpress.edu/blog/54246/racial-resentment-and-whites-feelings-toward-black-lives-matter-a-qa-with-dr-emmitt-y-riley-iii/>UC Press 2021</a>). The rise in anti-White hate crimes is surprising at first glance. But according to the Daily Beast, white nationalist groups are spinning stories of hate crimes against White people, which may have led to over-reporting anti-White hate crimes (<a href = https://www.thedailybeast.com/anti-white-watch-is-the-racist-answer-to-hate-crimes>Hay 2021</a>)."
